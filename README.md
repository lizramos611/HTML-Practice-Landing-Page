  ## Description
This is a Mini Project for UCF Coding Bootcamp. It's a landing page to show my skills with HTML and intro to CSS. I created a landing page to represent NYC with an input/form for point of contact.

  * CSS positioning
  * Use of Semantic Elements for HTML
  * Universal, Element and Class Selectors
  * Font colors, sizes, and families
  * Links and Images
  * Inputs and Forms
  * Deploying in Github Pages
